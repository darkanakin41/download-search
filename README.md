# DownloadSearch

DownloadSearch is a sandbox for me to play with [Symfony 4](https://symfony.com/), [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/), [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/), [Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html) and many more other stuff that i want.

The main functionnality is the aggregation of multiple download sites into one with a common search form.

## Functionality
* Search on different Download sites (Extreme Download and Annuaire Telechargement) and provide the original link

## TODO
* Create an advanced research form
* Create a detail page for a specific link
* Link the information with [themoviedb](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=fr) and [tvdb](https://www.thetvdb.com/)
* Create a user section

For connected users : 
* Subscribe to a serie and be notified when a new episode is out
* Display list of subscribed series
* Add a checkbox which save if the episode/movie have been downloaded
